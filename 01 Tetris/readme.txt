A new feature has been added, Special Clear Blocks.
These blocks clear all rows they are placed on, BUT gravity does not affect these rows (leading to the possibility of floating parts). They appear randomly as grey tetrominoes with arrows indicating their clear direction, so place them wisely when they show up!

Vertical clear blocks clear the lines they are placed in vertically while horizontal clear blocks do the same but horizontally.
